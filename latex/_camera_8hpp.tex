\hyperlink{namespace_the}{The} camera class is essentially a wrapper around a load of mat4s. Similar to N\+G\+Ls default camera class but it represents both the camera and a lookat target. \hyperlink{namespace_the}{The} user can transform both of these. When happy with the transformations they have set up, they can call methods to calculate the view and projection matrices.
