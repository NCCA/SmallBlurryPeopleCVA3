When doing a smooth interpolation between two values, I usually have to define them in a header somewhere and then write cur += (targ -\/ cur) / x This gets pretty tiresome and clutters the code up, especially in \hyperlink{_scene_8hpp_source}{Scene.\+hpp} which until recently suffered from my excessive variables used to track the camera transformation. I figure that wrapping this all up into a class lets me clean this up a bit.
